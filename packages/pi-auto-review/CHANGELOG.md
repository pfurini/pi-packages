# Changelog

## 0.16.0 - 2026-09-05

- Coordinated release for `@erichll/pi-sandbox 0.16.0`; the broker API and
  approval behavior are unchanged.

## 0.15.3 - 2026-09-03

- Tolerate a single enclosing ```` ```json ```` or bare Markdown code fence
  around reviewer decisions while preserving strict decision-schema
  validation (fixes reviewer models that fence JSON despite the prompt,
  notably when routed through Claude Code).
- Verify compatibility with `@gotgenes/pi-permission-system` 30.2.0 and
  31.0.0, widen the peer range through 31.x, and move the development baseline
  to 31.0.0.
- Keep permission-system 31 statement-operand audit classification aligned for
  `for`/`select` word lists and `case` subjects without treating case patterns
  as accessed paths.
- Confirm that model auto-confirm stays one-shot and cannot select
  permission-system 30.2's wider both-directions session grant.

## 0.15.2 - 2026-09-02

- No behavior changes. Verified against `@gotgenes/pi-permission-system`
  29.x with a development baseline of `29.3.0`; the peer range now accepts
  29.x alongside 28.x.
